For example
```
index.html
dist/entry-bundle.12345.js
```
Copy to production root folder
```
root_folder/index.html
root_folder/dist/entry-bundle.12345.js

## To clear cache

Clear tracing cache. In rare situation, you might need to run clear-cache after upgrading to new version of dumber bundler.

    npm run clear-cache
